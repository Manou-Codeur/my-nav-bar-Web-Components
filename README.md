# my-nav-bar-Web-Components
This components is too easy to use and it's soo simple, there is no animation or something like that.
You have only to assign your images to the <my-nav-bar> tag by using the attributes 'logo', 'menu' and 'close'. for example:

# <my-nav-bar logo="./img/polymer-24px.svg" menu="./img/menu-24px.svg" close="./img/close-24px.svg"></my-nav-bar>
 
 and don't forget to place the script tag inside the <head> tag like this: 
 
 <head>
    <script src='nav-bar.js'></script>
 </head>
